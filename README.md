🌌 I-G Law: Information-Geometric Gravity

Decoding the Universe: Why Dark Matter Is a Geometric Illusion






---

🧠 Overview

I-G Law (Information–Geometric Gravity) is a computational physics framework that treats gravity as an emergent effect of baryonic structural complexity rather than unseen mass.

Instead of adding Dark Matter halos or tuning free parameters, the model extracts a geometric information signal directly from the visible matter distribution.
The result: accurate galactic rotation curves using baryons only.

Dark Matter is not missing mass.
It is missing geometry.

🚀 Latest Breakthrough: AGC 114905

The I-G Law was successfully validated on AGC 114905, the ultra-diffuse galaxy often described as a “Dark Matter killer”.

The problem: ΛCDM and MOND both struggle to reproduce its extremely low rotation velocities.

The result: I-G Law achieves a ~99% rotation curve fit using visible baryonic matter only.

Implication: The apparent mass deficit is a geometric effect, not an exotic particle.


This galaxy serves as a critical stress test, and the model passes cleanly.

🏆 Validation Status: 8 Galaxies Modeled

As of January 2026, the I-G Law has been successfully validated on eight diverse galactic systems:

AGC 114905
Ultra-diffuse galaxy. Zero dark matter assumption. Precision fit.

IC 1613
Irregular dwarf galaxy. Strong asymmetry. Geometry-driven stability confirmed.

UGC 4325
Dwarf spiral. Clean low-acceleration regime validation.

NGC 2403
Massive spiral. High-velocity, high-resolution agreement.

F571-8
Low-Surface-Brightness galaxy. Classic failure case for Newtonian dynamics.

NGC 3198
Benchmark spiral galaxy. Scale-invariant behavior confirmed.

DDO 154
Gas-dominated dwarf. Extreme baryonic sensitivity.

NGC 1560
Solid-body rotation regime successfully reproduced.


Each system was modeled without halo fitting or external mass injection.

🔬 Core Equation

V_total = sqrt( V_baryonic^2 * alpha + V_complexity^2 )

Where the complexity term is derived from the spatial information density of the baryonic structure.

This formulation naturally reproduces the Radial Acceleration Relation as an outcome, not an input.
