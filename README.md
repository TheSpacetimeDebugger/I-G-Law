# 🌌 The I-G Law (Information-Gravity Law)
### "Order is the Hidden Gravity"

## 🚀 Overview
The **I-G Law** (Ibrahim-Gravity Law) is a new theoretical framework proposing that gravity is not only a result of mass but also a direct consequence of **Structural Information Complexity**. 

This project provides a Python simulation that solves the **Galaxy Rotation Problem** without the need for hypothetical "Dark Matter."

## 🔬 The Core Concept
Current physics (General Relativity) fails to explain why stars at the edges of galaxies rotate so fast. Scientists invented "Dark Matter" to fill this gap.
**The I-G Law** suggests that the high degree of order and complexity in galaxies generates an additional gravitational effect, represented by the **Complexity Factor (C)**.

## 📊 Digital Proof
In this repository, you will find simulations comparing:
1. **Classic Physics (Newton/Einstein):** Which fails to keep stars in orbit (The Red Curve).
2. **I-G Law:** Which perfectly matches observed flat rotation curves (The Green Curve).

## 🛠️ How to Run
This code is designed to be simple and accessible. You can run it on **Pydroid 3** (Android) or any PC with Python and Matplotlib.

```python
# Refer to the main.py file for the simulation code
