# 🌌 I-G Law: Information-Geometric Gravity
**"Deciphering Galactic Motion through Structural Complexity"**

[![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)

The **I-G Law** is a computational framework exploring an emergent gravity model. It proposes that galactic rotation curves can be explained by the **Structural Information Complexity (ℂ)** of baryonic matter, potentially removing the need for non-baryonic Dark Matter at galactic scales.

## 🏆 Major Milestone: The Triple Crown Validation
As of **January 21, 2026**, the I-G Law has successfully demonstrated high-precision fits for three distinct galactic morphologies:
1. **NGC 3198**: A classic giant spiral (Baryon-dominated).
2. **DDO 154**: A gas-dominated dwarf galaxy (The "Knee" alignment challenge).
3. **NGC 1560**: A low-surface-brightness spiral with sensitive inner bumps.

## 🔬 Core Concept
The total gravitational influence is modeled as:
$$V_{total} = \sqrt{V_{baryonic}^2 \cdot \alpha + V_{complexity}^2}$$

Where $V_{complexity}$ is derived from the geometric distribution of visible matter, mapping information density to gravitational "boost".
