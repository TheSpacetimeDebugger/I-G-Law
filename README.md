The **I-G Law** is a novel computational framework that explores gravity as an emergent phenomenon linked to the **Structural Information Complexity (ℂ)** of baryonic matter. This model demonstrates that galactic rotation curves can be accurately predicted using only visible matter, potentially bypassing the requirement for non-baryonic Dark Matter.

## 🏆 Validation Milestone: The "Triple Crown" Success
As of **January 21, 2026**, the I-G Law has successfully passed high-precision validation for three distinct galactic morphologies without any "Dark Matter" parameters:

1. **NGC 3198**: High-accuracy fit for classic giant spirals (Baryon-dominated).
2. **DDO 154**: Perfectly aligned with the "Knee" challenge in gas-dominated dwarfs.
3. **NGC 1560**: Captured sensitive inner-disk fluctuations in LSB spirals.

## 🔬 Scientific Core
The model introduces a geometric "boost" factor to Newtonian gravity:
$$V_{total} = \sqrt{V_{baryonic}^2 \cdot \alpha + V_{complexity}^2}$$

Where $V_{complexity}$ is a function of the spatial information density of the baryonic disk. This mapping suggests that what we perceive as "Dark Matter" may be the geometric signature of matter distribution complexity.
