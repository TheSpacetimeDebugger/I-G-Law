The **I-G Law** is a pioneering computational framework that explores gravity as an emergent phenomenon linked to the **Structural Information Complexity (ℂ)** of baryonic matter. This model demonstrates that galactic rotation curves can be accurately predicted using only visible matter, effectively bypassing the requirement for non-baryonic Dark Matter.

## 🏆 Validation Milestones: 6 Galaxies Deciphered
As of **January 22, 2026**, the I-G Law has successfully demonstrated high-precision validation for six distinct galactic morphologies without any "Dark Matter" parameters:

1. **NGC 3198**: High-accuracy fit for classic giant spirals.
2. **DDO 154**: Perfectly aligned with the "Knee" challenge in gas-dominated dwarfs.
3. **NGC 1560**: Captured sensitive inner-disk fluctuations in LSB spirals.
4. **NGC 2403**: Confirmed stability in massive spiral systems (Twin of M33).
5. **UGC 4325**: Validated structural information density in dwarf galaxies.
6. **F571-8**: (Latest Breakthrough) Successfully modeled complex rotation in Low-Surface-Brightness (LSB) systems, confirming the universal scaling of the complexity boost.

## 🔬 Scientific Core
The model introduces a geometric "boost" factor to Newtonian gravity:
$$V_{total} = \sqrt{V_{baryonic}^2 \cdot \alpha + V_{complexity}^2}$$

Where $V_{complexity}$ is a function of the spatial information density of the baryonic disk. This mapping suggests that what we perceive as "Dark Matter" is the geometric signature of matter distribution complexity.
